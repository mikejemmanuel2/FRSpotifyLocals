        <p>First of all, this is a tool to download Mp3 files of songs that are not originally on Spotify
            that I have placed in my playlists.</p>
        <p>If there is a song on Spotify that is greyed out, it is either not available anymore, or is a Local
        Song that has been put in that playlist.</p>
        <p>In my playlists, they are local songs. This tool downloads them, puts them in a folder, and shows you
        how to make Spotify recognize them so that you can play them.</p>
        <p><b>Web Spotify, Alexa, Chromecast and other casting tool CANNOT play local files<br>
            (As far as I know)<br></b></p>
        <p>By pressing on "Playlists" in the navigation bar, you can get started and pick a playlist you'd
            like to retrieve songs for.</p>
        <p><b>Instructions will be included along the way.</b></p>
